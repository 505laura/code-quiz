# Code Quiz

[Link to Deployed Application](https://505laura.github.io/code-quiz)

## Description
This webpage is designed as an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of coding.
Upon pressing the 'Start' button, you will be quizzed on 6 questions relating to JavaScript and have 90 seconds to answer all of them. For each incorrect answer, you will lose 10 seconds off the timer.
Your goal is to answer as many correctly in as little time as possible to get the highest score you can (completing the test in 60 seconds = a score of 60).
Once you have completed the score, you will be able to submit your initials to the leaderboard. The top 5 scores will be displayed.

## Usage

### Welcome Page
Read through the instructions on this page and once you are ready, click 'Start' to begin the timer and quiz.

There is a 'highscores' link at the top right of the page that you can click to access the leaderboard and see any scores there.

### Questions Page
The timer will instantly begin counting down from 90 seconds once you are on the first page containing a question and answers.
You are given four options for the question, one of them is correct.
* If you answer correctly, the answer button will turn green and you will progress to the next question. 
* If you answer incorrectly, the answer button will turn red, you will lose ten seconds off of the timer and also progress to the next question.

### Completed Challenge Page
Once you have answered all of the questions, there will be a page displaying your final score with a text input to enter your initials into if you wish to record your highscore and submit it to the leaderboard (by pressing 'Send').

### Highscores Page
This page will display the top five highscores (initials and score).
If you would like to attempt the quiz again, click 'Start Over'. Optionally, you can clear all of the highscores on the leaderboard by clicking 'Clear Highscores' for a fresh start.
